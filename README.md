## React Graph

A Graph component for displaying hierarchical data

## Development

The recommended workflow is to run the library compilation in one terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Then run the example app inside another:

```bash
cd example
npm start
```

For local development inside of another app, create an archive:

```bash
npm pack 
```

Then inside of the app run:

```bash
npm i ../path/to/archive.tgz
```

To run tests, use `npm test`.
